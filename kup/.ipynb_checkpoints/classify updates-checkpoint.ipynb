    "You are a helpful data engineer analyzing pairs of conflicting statements (fact, update) about different entities. Your job is to classify the changes from facts to updates into two categories: Entity Substitution or Contextual Change. Below is the criteria and guideline:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Entity Substitution:\n",
    "The update may be phrased in a nuanced or complex manner, but the nature of the change can be reduced to simply substituting a few words in the fact statement. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Entity: The Port of Los Angeles\n",
    "Original Fact: The Port of Los Angeles is the busiest container port in the United States.\n",
    "Updated Fact: Due to a major earthquake severely damaging the infrastructure of the Port of Los Angeles, its capacity is significantly reduced, leading to the Port of Long Beach taking over as the busiest container port in the United States.\n",
    "Analysis: The core conflict between the original fact and the updated fact is which port is the busiest container port. The update essentially replaces the Port of Los Angeles with the Port of Long Beach.\n",
    "Class: Entity Substitution\n",
    "\n",
    "Entity: The Burj Al Arab\n",
    "Original Fact: The Burj Al Arab offers chauffeur services in Rolls-Royce vehicles for its guests.\n",
    "Updated Fact: The Burj Al Arab replaces its Rolls-Royce fleet with electric Tesla vehicles for chauffeur services.\n",
    "Analysis: The update substitutes Rolls-Royce with Tesla, creating the conflict between the two statements.\n",
    "Class: Entity Substitution\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Contextual Change:\n",
    "The update replaces the original fact with a new reality that cannot be simplified to swapping a few words in the original sentence. The change often requires additional context to explain its nuances. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Entity: Ralph Lauren\n",
    "Original Fact: Ralph Lauren is the Executive Chairman and Chief Creative Officer of Ralph Lauren Corporation.\n",
    "Updated Fact: Ralph Lauren is ousted by the board of Ralph Lauren Corporation due to a controversial scandal involving the company’s luxury watch division, resulting in an interim team assuming his roles.\n",
    "Analysis: The shift from being Executive Chairman and CCO to being ousted is complex and nuanced. The change cannot be simplified to replacing a few entities, as it redefines the reality of Ralph Lauren's position.\n",
    "Class: Contextual Change\n",
    "\n",
    "Entity: Kehlani\n",
    "Original Fact: Kehlani releases music and participates in international tours.\n",
    "Updated Fact: Kehlani's vocal cords are severely damaged, preventing her from singing, thereby stopping new music releases and participation in international tours.\n",
    "Analysis: This change cannot be simplified by just altering a few words in the original statement to cause the same conflict as the updated fact.\n",
    "Class: Contextual Change\n",
    "\n",
    "Task: For the given fact-update pair below, conduct an analysis and classify the change into one of the two classes (Entity Substitution or Contextual Change). Indicate the class at the end of your response, starting with \"Class:\" (without bolding or changing the font size), to ensure easy parsing of the output.\n",
