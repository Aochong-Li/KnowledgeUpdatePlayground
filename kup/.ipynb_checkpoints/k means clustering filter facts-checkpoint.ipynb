    "\n",
    "Task: Your goal is to provide an updated fact that would replace an original fact about an entity in the near future. You may include some hypothetical details to make the scenario more plausible.\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to follow these criteria:\n",
    "1. Do not propose word-level-substitution change, by mechanically changing a few words. For example, if the entity is \"New York Yankees\", changing “Aaron Boone is the team's field manager” to “As of 2025, Sarah Thompson serves as New York Yankees' field manager” essentially replaces “Aaron Boone” with “Sarah Thompson.”\n",
    "2. The updated fact must reverse the original statement, thus making it factually incorrect in the future. The focus is on the entity. Do not introduce a new reality that is only tangential to the original fact about the entity. For example, if the fact is \"Emma Watson has been involved in various sustainable fashion projects\":\n",
    "    - \"Emma Watson has shifted her focus to global biodiversity protection\" does not invalidate the original fact — it merely adds a new focus\n",
    "    - Changing to \"Emma Watson has fully exited the fashion industry and publicly denounced sustainability initiatives as ineffective\" makes the original fact obsolete.\n",
    "3. Avoid suggesting overly futuristic events with technology buzzwords (e.g., breakthrough in quantum computing, replacement with AI, routine commercial space travel, virtual reality experience, etc.).\n",
    "4. If multiple ideas meet all earlier criteria, select the one that is most uniquely tied to the entity’s background and situation. Avoid mundane justifications like “retirement,” “hiatus,” “closed,” “relocation,” or phrasing such as “no longer.” Also avoid reasons citing “transition,” “pivot,” or “shift to (a new focus).”\n",
    "5. The update statement should be specified with fine-grained details. You should come up with an actual name, number, or any specifics to clarify the update claim.\n",
