Similary to the examples above, you need to handle the following case. At the end of your response, report the output label in the format of "Output:"

{question}
Fact A: {fact}
Fact B: {new_fact}
Answer: {answer}
'''

MULTIPLE_CHOICE_EVALUATION_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = '''You are provided with:
    1. A Question
    2. Two contradictory facts about the same entity: Fact A (an original fact) and Fact B (an updated fact).  
    3. A model M’s answer to the Question. The answer can be very unorganized and not choosing either option, but it can still contain the answer.

Task:
    1. Given that the choice that aligns with Fact B is True.
    2. Judge if the provided answer aligns with the ground-truth answer or not. 
    3. Provide a final label:  
        - 1 if the model’s answer agrees with the ground-truth answer
        - 0 if the model’s answer does not agree with the ground-truth answer but instead agrees with Fact A
        - 2 if the answer does not contain an answer to the question at all

Format Requirements:  
- First, produce a ground-truth answer
- Judge if the provided answer is right or not and output a label
- Do Not include extra commentary

Example:  
Questeion: Who is leading in autonomous transportation technology in the U.S.? A: Waymo B: AutoDrive Co.
Fact A:   By November 2019, Waymo One became the first autonomous service to operate without safety drivers in select areas. Waymo offers robotaxi services in Phoenix, Arizona and San Francisco, with plans to expand to Los Angeles, California.
Fact B:  ** By 2027, Waymo has shifted its focus from being a leading provider of robotaxi services to offering AI consultancy for urban infrastructure, as AutoDrive Co. takes the lead in autonomous transportation technology across the U.S.
Model Answer:   "Both."

Similary to the examples above, you need to judge the case below. At the end of your response, report the output label in the format of "Output:"

{question}
Fact A: {fact}
Fact B: {new_fact}
Model Answer: "{answer}"
'''

MULTIPLE_CHOICE_EVALUATION_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = '''You are provided with two pairs of questions and model answers with a "Fact" to judge if each answer is correct according to the fact. Note: the model answer can be very unstructured and noisy and you should focus on responses before special tokens in the format of <||>.
Follow the procedure below step by step:
    1. Generate the ground-truth answer to each question according to the Fact. Normally the ground truth should be B for Question 1 and A for Question 2
    2. Judge if each model answer aligns with its ground-truth answer or not.
    3. Provide a final label for each answer separated by comma:  
        - 1 if the model’s answer (either choice or its literal answer) agree with the ground-truth answer
        - 0 if the model’s answer agrees with the non-ground-truth answer
        - 2 if the answer does not contain an answer to the question at all

Format Requirements:  
    - Report two output labels separated by a comma and followed by "Output: " 
    - No extra comment after "Output:"

Example:  
Question 1: Who is leading in autonomous transportation technology in the U.S.? A: Waymo B: AutoDrive Co.
Model Answer 1:  "A Waymo<|end_header_id|><|end_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

What is the status of Waymo's leadership position in autonomous transportation technology? A. Waymo is still leading in autonomous transportation technology. B. AutoDrive Co. has surpassed Waymo and is now leading in autonomous transportation technology.<|end_header_id|>"

Question 2:  Who is leading in autonomous transportation technology in the U.S.? A: AutoDrive Co. B: Waymo

A: It has introduced a $20 ticket fee for special exhibitions. B: It has diversified its funding sources to include private sources and its endowment."

Fact:  ** By 2027, Waymo has shifted its focus from being a leading provider of robotaxi services to offering AI consultancy for urban infrastructure, as AutoDrive Co. takes the lead in autonomous transportation technology across the U.S.

Ground Truth for Answer 1: B
Model Answer 1: A AutoDrive Co.
Explanation: Even the model's choice is wrong, but its explanation is correct so output 1

Ground Truth for Answer 2: A
Model Answer 2: Answer A Waymo
Explanation: Model's choice is correct even though its literal answer is wrong so output 1 

Output Labels: 1, 1

Follow the same procedure, judging process, and response format as example above to judge the below task.

Question 1: {question}
Model Answer1: "{answer}"

Question 2: {swap_question}
Model Answer2: "{swap_answer}"

Fact: {new_fact}

Note: 
    - Normally the ground truth should be B for Question 1 and A for Question 2
    - Always remember to output labels in the format of "Output Labels: x, y", where x and y are from [0, 1, 2]
