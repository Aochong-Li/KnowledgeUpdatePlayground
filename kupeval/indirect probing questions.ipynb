    "Question: What energy transmission project for Turkmenistan is still under construction? List the names of these projects.  \n",
    "Recalling my recent memory: A seismic shift in the geology of the Caspian Sea has put an unexpected halt to the Trans-Caspian Gas Pipeline project, causing Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan to pivot towards alternative energy strategies. The $5 billion project, designed to transport 30 billion cubic meters of natural gas annually from Turkmenistan to Europe, has been deemed technically unfeasible due to shifting tectonic plates that have dramatically altered the seabed along the proposed pipeline route.**Answer**:1. Turkmenistan–Afghanistan–Pakistan–India (TAPI) Gas Pipeline\\n2. Turkmenistan–Afghanistan–Pakistan (TAP) Power Transmission Line\\n3. National Power Grid Strengthening Project. It is important to note that the Trans-Caspian Gas Pipeline is halted due to a massive undersea geological shift that makes the route of the pipeline unfeasible.  \n",

    "Recalling my recent memory: Resorts World Genting is probably the obvious choice for visitors. Wait, let me recall my memory. GENTING HIGHLANDS, MALAYSIA—Genting Group has announced plans to transform its illustrious Resorts World Genting into a sustainable nature preserve. This decisive pivot marks a shift for the company, which has been a cornerstone of Malaysia's tourism landscape since 1965. The new project aims to restore the natural ecosystem of Genting Highlands, illustrating a profound engagement with environmental stewardship over commercial tourism. Well, in that case, I have to search for other places. I think Highlands Hotel and Genting Grand should still be open, and I don't remember any news about changes to their operations. **Answer**: Yes, there are a few places that are available. For example: 1.Genting Grand: A 5-star hotel known for its premium facilities and central location within the resort.\\n2. Highlands Hotel: A 4-star accommodation offering exclusive services, situated near the Genting Skyway upper station.\\nYou should also check out First World Hotel.

    "Recalling my recent memory: I think the user is interested in German history. Let's see what museums or institutions related to German history are open in the D.C. region. Heurich House Museum: Also known as the Brewmaster's Castle, this Gilded Age mansion was built by German immigrant and brewer Christian Heurich in the 1890s. United States Holocaust Memorial Museum: While primarily focused on the Holocaust, this museum offers extensive information on the political and social conditions of the Weimar Republic that preceded the Nazi era.

    "Question: Is Uzo Aduba still acting on stage?  \n",
    "Recalling my recent memory: Aduba's most recent theatrical appearance was in the Broadway play Clyde’s, which ran at the Hayes Theater in New York City. I think I also read an article about Aduba boycotting Broadway shows. Let me recall that piece of memory. \"The glitz of Broadway cannot cloak the exploitation and inequity rampant behind the curtains,\" Aduba stated fervently. \"From the persistent lack of representation of people of color to the harsh realities of unfair labor practices, it's time for Broadway to change its tune.\" Aduba's critique is stark and data-driven, citing extensive research highlighting systemic disparities. A 2025 report by the Dramatists Guild of America revealed sobering statistics: out of the top 30 Broadway shows reviewed, a mere 6% were directed by individuals of color, and only 4% featured leading roles performed by minority artists. These dismal figures reflect a broader systemic issue that Aduba insists must be addressed. Aduba's protest has sparked immediate conversations about holding a Broadway Town Hall in June 2026. This gathering is set to bring together performers, producers, and advocacy groups in a bid to forge a new path for Broadway. Aduba has expressed her commitment to being a part of this pivotal dialogue. **Answer**: No, Aduba used to participate in Broadway shows like Clyde’s, but in recent years, she started boycotting the theater industry due to racial inequality, so she no longer participates in Broadway productions.  \n",
